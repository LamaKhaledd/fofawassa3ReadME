## 🌟 About the Project
<strong>RentItOut</strong> is a peer-to-peer rental platform designed to make renting everyday items easy, reliable, and efficient. It connects people who have items to rent with those who need them, facilitating a convenient and cost-effective way to access products without purchasing them. The goal is to create a circular economy that encourages sharing and reduces the need for people to purchase items they only need occasionally.

## 2. Main Features
### Item Listings for Rent
- 🛠️ <strong> Allow users to list items they rarely use, such as tools, electronics, sports equipment, and more. Listings can be organized into various categories to facilitate item discovery.</strong>This was done by implementing CRUD operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete item listing and developing endpoints to handle different categories, enabling efficient filtering and searching.
  <br>
  
### Rental Management and Pricing
- 📊  <strong> Manage rental durations, set flexible pricing models, and allow users to specify rental periods and conditions. </strong>Define pricing and duration models in the backend by using database tables to store rental rates and durations, and develop endpoints to handle rental availability, pricing rules, and extensions.
  <br>

### Trust, Safety, and Verification
- 🛡️  <strong> User verification, rating, and review systems to ensure safe and reliable transactions. Develop mechanisms for security deposits or damage protection. </strong>Integrate identity verification for users, potentially via third-party verification APIs. 
  <br>
  
### Logistics: Delivery and Pickup
- 🚚 <strong> Provide options for delivery or in-person pickup, with the potential for location-based matchmaking to facilitate exchanges. </strong>Integrate map-based location services to assist with pickup arrangements and delivery logistics.
  <br>

### Revenue Model and Insurance
- 💰 <strong> Define how the platform generates revenue, such as through service fees. Integrate insurance or damage protection. </strong>Calculate and implement platform fees or commissions for each transaction. 
  <br>
