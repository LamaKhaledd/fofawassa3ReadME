## 🌟 About the Project
<strong>RentItOut</strong> is a peer-to-peer rental platform designed to make renting everyday items easy, reliable, and efficient. It connects people who have items to rent with those who need them, facilitating a convenient and cost-effective way to access products without purchasing them. The goal is to create a circular economy that encourages sharing and reduces the need for people to purchase items they only need occasionally.

## 2. Main Features
### 🛠️ Item Listings for Rent
- <strong> Allow users to list items they rarely use, such as tools, electronics, sports equipment, and more. Listings can be organized into various categories to facilitate item discovery.</strong>This was done by implementing CRUD operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete item listing and developing endpoints to handle different categories, enabling efficient filtering and searching.
  <br>
  
### 📊 Rental Management and Pricing
- <strong> Manage rental durations, set flexible pricing models, and allow users to specify rental periods and conditions. </strong>Define pricing and duration models in the backend by using database tables to store rental rates and durations, and develop endpoints to handle rental availability, pricing rules, and extensions.
  <br>

### 🛡️ Trust, Safety, and Verification
- <strong> User verification, rating, and review systems to ensure safe and reliable transactions. Develop mechanisms for security deposits or damage protection. </strong>Integrate identity verification for users, potentially via third-party verification APIs. 
  <br>
  
### 🚚 Logistics: Delivery and Pickup
- <strong> Provide options for delivery or in-person pickup, with the potential for location-based matchmaking to facilitate exchanges. </strong>Integrate map-based location services to assist with pickup arrangements and delivery logistics.
  <br>

### 💰 Revenue Model and Insurance
- <strong> Define how the platform generates revenue, such as through service fees. Integrate insurance or damage protection. </strong>Calculate and implement platform fees or commissions for each transaction. 
  <br>

### ⭐ User Experience and Recommendations
- <strong> Enhance the user experience by offering personalized recommendations and a user-friendly interface.</strong> Leverage data on user interactions and item popularity to provide recommendations.
